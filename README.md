# Milestone 2 Prototype

## SFSU CSC 648/848 project

ShopU is an electronic commerce website that provides consumer-to-consumer 
sales services exclusively to students attending San Francisco State University.

Visit our [site](http://sfsuswe.com/~su16g03/prototype) and type into the search 
bar on the homepage to see the products being sold by users on the site.

The categories available for items currently are furniture, electronics, 
clothes, and books (more to come soon).

In order to sell items to other users, you must first sign in to your account 
(sign up if you don't have an account).

For the main prototype search functionality, the app delegates the handling of 
search bar input to the Search controller, which works with the DB model and returns 
data back to the items view. User registration made possible using PHP sessions.

TODO: Rewrite UMLs & APIs in favor of PDO + 'buy item' functionality
