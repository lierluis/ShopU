# Milestone 2 Prototype

## SFSU CSC 648/848 project

Visit our [site](http://sfsuswe.com/~su16g03/prototype) and type into the search 
bar on the homepage to see our products. We currently offer furniture, electronics, 
clothes, and books as categories.

For the main prototype search functionality, the app delegates the handling of 
search bar input to the Search controller, which works with the DB model and returns 
data back to the items view.

Extra: there are currently also options to add items and view/add users to the 
database (user functionality still in its infancy).

TODO: Adhere to UMLs & APIs + User registration (?)
