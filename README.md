# Milestone 2 Prototype

## SFSU CSC 648/848 project

Visit our [site](http://sfsuswe.com/~su16g03/prototype) and type into the search 
bar on the homepage to see our products. We currently offer furniture, electronics, 
clothes, and books as categories.

For the main prototype search functionality, the app delegates the handling of 
search bar input to the Search controller, which works with the DB model and returns 
data back to the items view.

There is also currently the option to signup with an account (using sessions),
though the functionality of the app has yet to change based on whether or not a
user is signed in.
