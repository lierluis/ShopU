# ShopU

## SFSU CSC 648/848 project

ShopU is a mock electronic commerce website that provides consumer-to-consumer
sales services exclusively to students attending San Francisco State University.

Note: This project was initially hosted on the class server but has since been
taken down. I'm currently in the process of deploying it back to AWS. Click
